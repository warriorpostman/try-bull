# Queues using Javascript

Each of the three examples in this repo will send and receive a few messages. Requirements to run each example are listed below:

## RabbitMQ
Install Rabbit MQ and start the service. This example uses localhost + default port.

## Bull queues (Redis-backed queue solution for Node)
Install a Redis server locally, and start it up. This example uses localhost + default port.

## AWS SQS (AWS built-in queues)
This requires you configure a queue in AWS Console and have the access key ID + secret stored locally in the ~/.aws/credentials file. `TODO: Make the queue name configurable`

`TODO: Instructions on best way to run each example locally.`
